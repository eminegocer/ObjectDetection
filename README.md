# Arduino and Raspberry Pi4 Object Detection Project

## Description
This project focuses on object detection using Arduino, Raspberry Pi 4, and the YOLOv4 model. A USB camera connected to the Raspberry Pi 4 captures the images, and objects are detected using the YOLOv4 model. When a specific object is identified, the corresponding LED on the Arduino is triggered to light up. The project aims to evaluate the performance and efficiency of Arduino and Raspberry Pi 4 hardware in real-time object detection.

## Features
- Object detection using YOLOv4.
- Real-time object identification via a USB camera connected to Raspberry Pi 4.
- Arduino triggers LEDs to indicate recognized objects.
- Performance and efficiency measurement of Arduino and Raspberry Pi 4 hardware.

## Technologies Used
- **Hardware**:
  - Arduino
  - Raspberry Pi 4
  - USB Camera
  - LEDs
- **Software**:
  - YOLOv4 Object Detection Model
  - Python for Raspberry Pi programming
  - Arduino IDE for microcontroller programming
  - OpenCV for image processing

## Setup
1. Connect the USB camera to the Raspberry Pi 4.
2. Upload the Arduino code to the microcontroller using the Arduino IDE.
3. Install necessary Python libraries for YOLOv4 on the Raspberry Pi:
## Model Files
